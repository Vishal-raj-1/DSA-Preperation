/*
Question:- We are given three towers one is source , one is helper other is destination . We have to shift all the disks from source to destnation using helper tower.
There are some conditions which are:-
1. We can't put larger disk on smaller one.
2. We can take only one disk at a time.
3. We can take help of helper tower to shift disks.
*/

/*
Approach:-
1. If there is only one disk then simply shift it at destination from source.
2. Otherwise, Put all the disks at helper tower except the last one and move last disk to destonation.
3. Atlast move remaining n-1 disks from helper to destination.
