# Recursion 

- <div class = "text-red"> </div> Defination:- Recursion is the way of solving a problem in which we take some decisions because of which our problem gets converted into subtasks which is terminated at a base case.

- There are two ways to think:-
1. Decision making .
2. Smaller input.

+ There are three approaches to come up with code of a recursion problem which are as follows:-

✨ IBH :- IBH stands for (Induction Base case Hypotheses).
✨ Recursion tree.
✨ Choice Diagram.

✨ IBH:-

* INDUCTION- It is the way to apply hypotheses we generated to write code.
* BASE CASE- At this , we have to terminate our recursion call.
* HYPOTHESES- It is the idea for solving the problem .

✨ Recursion Tree:- It is the way we take our decisions and because of decisions our input become smaller at each and every decision . At last what we have is a tree like structure. It is made by input/output method.
After making recursion tree , writing code will be cakewalk for us.
