# Recursion 

- Defination:- Recursion is the way of solving a problem in which we take some decisions because of which our problem gets converted into subtasks which is terminated at a base case.

- There are two ways to think:-
1. Decision making .
2. Smaller input.
3. Some Data Structres like Trees,Graph(DFS,BFS)...

- There are three approaches to come up with code of a recursion problem which are as follows:-

1. IBH :- IBH stands for (Induction Base case Hypotheses).
2. Recursion tree.
3. Choice Diagram.

## IBH

* INDUCTION- It is the way to apply hypotheses we generated to write code.
* BASE CASE- At this , we have to terminate our recursion call.
* HYPOTHESES- It is the idea for solving the problem .

## Recursion Tree 
It is the way we take our decisions and because of decisions our input become smaller at each and every decision.At last what we have is a tree like structure. It is made by input/output method. We get our base condition at leaf nodes of the recursive tree.
After making recursion tree , writing code will be cakewalk for us.

## Choice Diagram
Problem like subset of string or choice of path(left,right,down,up).
