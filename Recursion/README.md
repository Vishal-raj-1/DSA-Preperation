# Recursion 

- Defination:- Recursion is the way of solving a problem in which we take some decisions because of which our problem gets converted into subtasks which is terminated at a base case.

- There are two ways to think:-
1. Decision making .
2. Smaller input.

+ There are three approaches to come up with code of a recursion problem which are as follows:-
1. IBH :- IBH stands for (Induction Base case Hypotheses).
2. Recursion tree.
3. Choice Diagram.
