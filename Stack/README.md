# Stack

## What is Stack?
=> Stack is a data structure in which the element which is last in is first out (LIFO) .

## How to identify that the given problem can be solved using stack?
* After observing the problem you will think of solving it using nested for loop in O(n^2) time complexity.
* Second for loop will be dependent on the first for loop.
* Using stack it can be solved in O(n).
