# Heap

Heap is a tree based data structure in which we can store our elements and perform tasks efficiently.

## Heap is of two types :-
1. Maximum Heap :- In this heap maximum element will be at the top of the heap.
2. Minimum Heap :- In this heap minimum element will be at the top of the heap.

### How to determine that the given question can be solved using heap ?
=> We will search two keywords:-
* k
* largest/smallest

### How to make choice between minimum and maximum heap?
* If we have smallest keyword in our problem then we will make a maximum heap.
* If we have largest/greatest keyword in our problem then we will make a minimum heap.

Data structure we use for heap is Priority Queue.
