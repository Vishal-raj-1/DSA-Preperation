/* https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

Question:- Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Approach:-
As we have to find kth largest so we will make a minimum heap , and will pop the element from it if its size is greater than k because everytime its size is greater than k
then it will have the element smaller than kth largest element at its top .

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>>q;
        for(auto i : nums)
        {
            q.push(i);
            if(q.size() > k)
                q.pop();
        }
        return q.top() ;
    }
};
