# Dynamic Programming

## Defination:- 
Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion by which we can reduce the time complexity by trading with time and space complexities.

### Recursion + Memoization = Dynamic Programming

### We just convert that memoized version of recursion into iteration by using a DP matrix to store the values for particular inputs so that we don't have to process them again.
