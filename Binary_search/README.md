# Binary Search

## Defination:-
Binary Search is a method to find the required element in a sorted array by repeatedly halving the array and searching in the half.

## Process:-
This method is done by starting with the whole array. Then it is halved. If the required data value is greater than the element at the middle of the array, 
then the upper half of the array is considered. Otherwise, the lower half is considered. This is done continuously until either the required data value is
obtained or the remaining array is empty.

## How to identify that the given problem can be solved by binary Search?
* You have to search keyword "Sorted".
* If you find sorted word in problem then 100% it can be solved using binary search very efficiently.
